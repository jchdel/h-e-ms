Another Bash script!

This script appears to be designed to read data from a CSV file, convert it into MQTT messages, and then publish those messages to an MQTT broker.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. The first line sets the shebang to `/bin/bash`, which specifies the shell interpreter to use.
2. `set -e` enables the "exit on error" feature, which means that if any command within the script fails (i.e., returns a non-zero exit status), the script will terminate immediately.
3. The `MQTT_HOST`, `MQTT_USER`, and `MQTT_PASS` variables are defined as empty strings. These values are likely set by an external file or environment variable, given that the script
includes `/etc/mqtt/credentials` using the `. ` syntax.
4. The script then enters a loop that reads lines from a CSV file (`/etc/1-wire/sensors.csv`) and processes each line as follows:
	* `IFS="," read -r TOPIC FILE`: This line uses the Internal Field Separator (IFS) to split the input line into two variables, `TOPIC` and `FILE`, using the comma character `,` as the 
separator.
	* `/usr/bin/mosquitto_pub ...`: This command publishes an MQTT message with the following characteristics:
	        + `-h $MQTT_HOST`: Sets the host name of the MQTT broker to the value stored in the `MQTT_HOST` variable.
	        + `-u $MQTT_USER`: Sets the username for the MQTT connection to the value stored in the `MQTT_USER` variable.
	        + `-P $MQTT_PASS`: Sets the password for the MQTT connection to the value stored in the `MQTT_PASS` variable.
	        + `-t $TOPIC`: Sets the topic name for the MQTT message to the value stored in the `TOPIC` variable.
	        + `-m "$(date +%s);$(cat $FILE)"`: Creates an MQTT message with a payload containing:
		                - The current timestamp (in seconds) obtained using `date +%s`.
		                - The contents of the file specified by the `FILE` variable, which is likely a sensor reading or measurement data.
5. Finally, the script uses `tail -n +2 /etc/1-wire/sensors.csv` to read only the lines starting from the second line (i.e., skipping the header) and pipes that output to the loop using
`<`.

Overall, this script appears to be a simple data publisher that reads sensor readings or measurement data from a CSV file, converts it into MQTT messages, and then publishes those
messages to an MQTT broker.
