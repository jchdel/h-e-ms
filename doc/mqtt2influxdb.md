This is a Bash script that appears to be designed to listen to an MQTT broker (Mosquitto) and forward incoming messages to an InfluxDB database. Here's a breakdown of what the code
does:

1. The script sets some environment variables and defines a few functions:
	* `ctrl_c`: This function handles the Ctrl+C signal, cleaning up and exiting with a status code.
	* `send_to_influxdb`: This function takes three arguments: `id`, `value`, and `timestamp`. It sends the data to an InfluxDB database using the `influx` command.
	* `listen`: This is the main listening loop. It reads lines from standard input, extracts relevant information (topic, ID, value, and timestamp), and calls the `send_to_influxdb` func
function to send the data to InfluxDB.
2. The script sets up some default values for variables:
	* `WORKDIR`: The working directory for the script (default is `/var/local/$ME`).
	* `MQTT_TOPIC`: The MQTT topic to listen to (default is `feeds`).
	* `DATABASE`: The name of the InfluxDB database to use (default is the same as the MQTT topic).
3. The script defines a trap function (`ctrl_c`) that will be triggered when the user presses Ctrl+C.
4. The main loop of the script uses `mosquitto_sub` to subscribe to the specified MQTT topic and its subtopics. The output from `mosquitto_sub` is piped to the `listen` function, which
processes each line.

Some notable features of this script include:

* It uses `mosquitto_sub` to subscribe to the MQTT broker, which allows it to listen to multiple topics at once.
* It uses `influx` to send data to an InfluxDB database. This suggests that the script is designed to collect data from an MQTT-based system and store it in a time-series database for
analysis or visualization.
* The script includes some basic error handling, such as printing error messages if the `send_to_influxdb` function fails.

Overall, this script appears to be designed to collect and forward data from an MQTT broker to an InfluxDB database, making it a useful tool for monitoring and analyzing IoT devices or
other systems that produce time-series data.
