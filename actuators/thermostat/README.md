In the old farm I rent, the physical thermostt is located above the oven...

I have a Toon running in the kitechen and 4 EmonTh scattered accros the home. All sending their temperature measurements to EmonHub.

A GNU/Linux cronjob fetch values from EmonCMS (API) and follows a decision tree to activate, or deactivate or let in current state, the furnace reagarding of the legacy thermostat forced in full heating mode.
